[174]~“You are brainwashed … don’t know the life outside. You are brainwashed from the time you know how to talk, about 4 years of age, from nursery school, brainwashing through education, this happens everywhere in life, society, even at home … North Korea is not open to the outside world, is a fenced world. So nothing should come through that fence. Even listening to the radio, this is restricted to certain channels. They want the people to be blind, deaf to the outside world, so that the people won’t know what is happening.”
[229]~“My friends, people who used to be writers … [w]e are never allowed to write our ideas, our thoughts … for example, this writer, he slipped when he was talking to someone else. He was drunk at the time, he slipped and he said that writers are never allowed to write their ideas and just by saying that, he was sent to Yodok, Camp No. 15...”
[230]~“There are lots of people who were taken like that, especially in the media. If you are in the media in North Korea, if you slip, it becomes a political issue. And as Mr. Jang said, we saw a lot of people taken away to the kwanliso, the political camps. So some people, the general criminals go to the correctional camps, but these writers, the people in the media, if they slip just once, they can disappear overnight and their family can be gone overnight, and sometimes, the three generations are wiped [out]. So you see, some people are told that, people think that they deserve it because they turned their backs on the regime. This is what the people think.”
[256]~“[i]n North Korea, the only ideology, the only religion that is allowed is the ideology of Kim Il-sung”
[257]~“Well you can consider the entire North Korean society as some sort of religious group with the religious leader being Kim Il-sung and their Bible being the Juche or self-reliance ideology. So if there are any other religions be that Christianity or Catholicism or whatever, if there’s any other religions that are somewhat in competition with that -- their main religion then it will be undermining the basic foundation of the Kim Il-sung religion so that will mean more difficulty for the leadership to maintain or the control of the society. So if the North Koreans start to realize that Kim Il-sung might not be the real god and there might be some other god out there then it’s not a good thing for the leadership and that’s why they wanted to avoid all the other religions occurring in North Korean society and persecuted other religions.”
[278]~“To my knowledge, North Korea believes that religion is like narcotics or drugs, and, as a result, it should be completely rooted out. This is expressive of the Marxist belief that religion is the opiate of the masses.”
[333]~“my grandfather actually got married in China and there my dad was born. And they did not come down to North Korea until my dad was eleven years old. So I do not think my family was part of a very high or good class in North Korea.”
[335]~“Because we were POWs, we were discriminated against. They were looking down on us. Although we married North Korean women, our children were controlled, our children were kept under surveillance. They did not really give us good jobs; there were just no opportunities to make better lives for our children.”
[336]~“Why are we even born?”
[370]~One witness whose wife traded in the market, explained that he did not engage in the market because it was “embarrassing”. He told the Commission that he also heard “rumours that men who engaged in the black market get punished. From 2002-03, more men have worked in the markets, but there is still a stigma attached to it. Men are expected to work in the official jobs.”
[374]~“Domestic violence is quite common. There is no law on this: family issues stay within the family. Even if a woman complains, the police will not interfere in family business.”
[375]~“[Violence against women] is considered a family matter. Only if the person is seriously injured then it becomes public. It is frequent. There is no place to complain. It can be used as a cause of divorce. Nothing is done to the husband even if the woman is severely beaten.”
[390]~“In North Korea, we call people with disabilities, the crippled, or people with a lot shortcomings or they use a derogative term to refer to the specific part of their body that is disabled. For example, if you don’t have a hand, or missing a wrist like me, then they would refer to it as a gravel hand. They have derogative terms for blind people, for people who have hearing disabilities. And even instead of names, even to refer to my family, they refer to my family as the family of the gravel hand. So that’s [the] kind of the prejudice that we encountered.”
[394]~“there is still a high level of discrimination against people with disabilities. In regions where they get a lot of foreign visitors, they limit the residence of people with disabilities.”
[410]~“I am a person of good songbun, good class in North Korea. My grandfather was also involved in anti-Japanese activities. And two of my father’s siblings died during the Korean War so I was one of those really privileged, high class, high songbun. But I’m from China, but if I was not born in China, if I was born in North Korea, then I could have been able to work in the core institutions, but because I was born in China, I was not able to work [for the] BoAnBu or Bowibu [MPS or SSD]. That is why I had to work in the press.”
[415]~“[T]he girls were always coming to me saying that school officials had requested a certain amount of supplies from every student’s family. Sometimes they would say their teachers told them they needed to bring in 2 kilograms of brass each by Monday. Or a kilogram of lead. Or a hundred meters of copper wire. They asked for coal, gasoline, even rabbit skins.” These specific requests were in addition to the 60 kilograms of corn that he had to send every month to the school. “That’s 2.2 pounds per daughter every day, even though a student’s ration is only a pound per day, so you can see that someone, somewhere, was skimming more than half of what we sent.”
[423]~“Working conditions were difficult. There was always a shortage of medicine. It was distributed from high levels at the national level down to the county, and misappropriated by officials who sold it on the black market [for money]. Consequently, doctors did not have medicines to use and could only write prescriptions. A more alarming side-effect of the misappropriation of medicines was the sale of dangerous ‘knock-offs’ that flooded the markets. Entrepreneurs mixed liquid antibiotics with fuel and mixed pills with flour to make more money. As a result, many people presented to hospital with infections and problems from using knock-off antibiotics. It was well known in the medical profession that bottles, lids and labels from the Suncheon factory for antibiotics were regularly stolen for the containment and sale of knock-off antibiotics. Although patients can technically go to the hospital at any time of day, the staff are rarely there after lunch as they had to engage in other business to make money to feed their families, or shop and do household chores”
[423]~“Party staff carry out nominal inspections of the hospitals each year. They are fully aware of the deficiencies of the hospital and the health situation of the community, but are bribed by the head of the hospital not to report the conditions. Staff are also expected to give money so a party could be put on for the visiting officials. Bribery and corruption are the norm in the DPRK. The officials are also the ones siphoning off the supplies, so they are more than aware of the situation. Party officials always given priority in the hospital, treated in separate rooms; they have no interest in how the rest of the population is suffering.”
[439]~70,000 people from 15,000 families who were classified as belonging to the hostile class were banished to remote mountainous areas. “Many of the areas they were banished to became prison camps.”
[441]~“I was born in a mining area. A lot of people starved to death at the time. For livelihood, there wasn’t much we could do to stay alive. We were surrounded by mountains. So we had to dig roots and [eat] the skins of trees and grass.”
[455]~“We were sleeping at night at the Chongjin train station. We were picking up food around the train station, and, when we were begging, people were more than willing to give us food. So, when there are no people around the train station, in the Chongjin city, there are houses for the officials. And if you go around the official’s housing or apartments, they have food that they have thrown away so those kind[s] of food we could eat.”
[456]~“The shelters had no food to give. So many children starved to death, even at these shelters. And even the police said if you go to the shelters, the children die, but if they were allowed to be street children, they would survive.”
[512]~“By the time he reached Musan, his face was covered with blood, his clothes were all torn. And when he fell, they stopped the truck and rushed him to stand up again. At the time my brother was discharged [from the army] for malnutrition, and he was diabetic. My mother tried to treat his diabetes in the hospital so he was diabetic at the time he went to China. … Even when my brother collapsed, the truck would go on and the Bowibu people, when my brother collapsed, would beat my brother up to make him stand up. Musan is a big city but they drove him around Musan city three times so that everybody could see him.”
[531]~“The prisoners were told to get in the hole and remove their clothes. We had to throw the clothes to the guards who would keep them if they liked them. We were forced to jump and do pumping. Then someone put their hands in everyone’s vagina and anus to check for money or other valuables. We were all together at this time, males and females. After the body search, we were forced to kneel in a cell on our hands and knees.”
[535]~Ms J. told the Commission that the searches “made us feel degraded as women. We were stripped naked when we were arrested, they searched our bodies, even our vaginas. They made us squat and stand, repeatedly.”
[549]~“[E]very morning we were given a small container full of water to wash our face and this particular day I used it to the water to wash the soiled towel but I was found out and I was punished for misusing the water. I had to wear the bloody towel over my head, which was my punishment for the whole day.”
[557] ~A woman who had been repatriated several times and witnessed two pregnant women subjected to forced abortions told the Commission,“if you get pregnant in China, the assumption is that you have been impregnated by a Chinese man, therefore women returning to the DPRK pregnant are subjected to forced abortions.”
[562]~“Forced abortion and forced murder of new-borns are carried out. North Korean defectors who got pregnant in China, if they are repatriated back, they are blamed for carrying the child of a Chinese national and they are put to receive forced abortion or, if they give birth, that child is killed.”
[585]~“…there was this pregnant woman who was about 9 months pregnant. She worked all day. The babies who were born were usually dead, but in this case the baby was born alive. The baby was crying as it was born; we were so curious, this was the first time we saw a baby being born. So we were watching this baby and we were so happy. But suddenly we heard the footsteps. The security agent came in and this agent of the Bowibu said that… usually when a baby is born we would wash it in a bowl of water, but this agent told us to put the baby in the water upside down. So the mother was begging. ‘I was told that I would not be able to have the baby, but I actually got lucky and got pregnant so let me keep the baby, please forgive me’, but this agent kept beating this woman, the mother who just gave birth. And the baby, since it was just born, it was just crying. And the mother, with her shaking hands she picked up the baby and she put the baby face down in the water. The baby stopped crying and we saw this water bubble coming out of the mouth of the baby. And there was an old lady who helped with the labour, she picked up the baby from the bowl of water and left the room quietly. So those kind of things repeatedly happened. That was in the detention centre in the city of Chongjin ofHamgyong Province.”
[586]~“… if the child is born, then the child is put to death immediately. Sometimes, the mouth and the nose are covered with a wet cloth leading to the suffocation of the baby. We have several testimonies. Sometimes, the baby is put face down, so that the baby cannot breathe, and this is one way of killing the baby, and within a few minutes or within a few hours, the baby would cry in pain because it cannot breathe. Regardless, the mother of the baby is made to witness this next to [her] baby.”
[598]~“All the guards would hit your breasts as you walked by. If someone who is more attractive is caught, then they would be treated as a sexual play thing. Some girls get pregnant in the prison.”
[621]~“In 2003, a broker who came regularly to the market convinced me I could work in China and earn a lot of money growing ginseng. Brokers came on a daily basis to the market to get women out of the DPRK. I know a lot of women who left this way. I went with the broker on the impression I would be going to a farm, but once in China I realized I was being trafficked, and sold by the broker. I was with 8 other women, when we got to […] location in China4 or 5 men were waiting for us in a car. I later learnt I was sold for 8,000 North Korean won.”
[622]~“I was sold to that house. I was not sold as a worker, but in China there were a lot of unmarried men. They were short of women so he bought me to be his wife. So I wasn’t paid. In China, at least I didn’t starve but I was hungry when I was in North Korea.”
[623]~“[A man] told us, me and the girls who lived in my neighbourhood, that we could get money [selling grass] in Gosari [in the DPRK]. I left my 9 year old brother behind. But when we arrived we found that we were in China. … We were taken to a house and there were five traffickers there. They were all men inside a green house. We spent about a week there. … We had no idea that the brokers were going to sell us to old Chinese men who were unable to get married.”
[625]~“If you look at the human trafficking pattern that occurred in the past, there are people who look for these women inside North Korea and there are brokers in China so these people who collect these North Korean women in North Korea, after they collect women they send them to China to the brokers [traffickers] and in China, these brokers [traffickers] sell these women to the Chinese in return for money. … Trafficking peaked six or seven years ago. Women are victimized through human trafficking. Some are aware they are being sold [and go through with it] so that they can provide food for their family, but some are lied to, are lured to be sold.”
[703]~“My father, because of malnourishment, passed away early in the morning of the 16th of February 1996… In April 1997 my older sister and my younger sister died of starvation. And, in 1998, my younger brother also died.”
[704]~“When my younger brother was born… my grandmother actually wanted to kill [him] because my mom was very undernourished and she was not able to lactate. [My mother] begged my grandmother saying, ‘Please do not kill the baby.’ … I had to take care of this baby brother. So I was piggybacking him around the town and sometimes my grandmother had to carry him around to make him stop crying. But as I mentioned, because there was no food, he was not able to stop crying. … [My] baby brother died in my arms because he was not able to eat. And because I was holding him so much, he thought I was his mom. So when I was feeding him water, he was sometimes looking at me smiling at me.”
[705] ~“Within five months from when I came back from the army in the 1990s my older brother died and, the next year, my younger brother died. My third brother died of malnutrition … later on.”
[706]~When he had to bury three of his brothers who died from starvation he thought that there was something wrong in the DPRK: “My brother survived the war in the fifties and why he had to die [in the 1990s]? Why did my brothers have to die in peacetime?”
[707]~“My [older] sister’s dying wish was to eat noodles, but there was no money to buy even one bowl of noodles. She died in 1997. My younger sister died just one month later. Her dying wish was to eat a slice of bread. My younger brother had been working at the Koowon coal mine from 1995, but he was so weak he was fired. He died of malnutrition on the train on the way back home. I found his body.”
[709]~“It’s as vivid as if it happened yesterday. In the 1990s, especially in Hamgyong region, the famine began in 1994. … in one day, 80 people from [my neighbourhood] died. So many people died that we didn’t have enough coffins so we borrowed [traditional burial boards] to give them burials. We didn’t have any wood to even give tombstones. That’s how many people died.”
[711]~“We would eat tree bark, and we would get the roots of the cabbage under the ground, but that was just not enough. As time passed, our grandmother and other weak people were just not able to move at all.”
[718]~“I realized the need for freedom in 1996….All I had to do was work because the government was giving me the rice and food. And that’s what I did up until 1996 but the rations stopped in 1996. And people started doing business, committing crimes, people started stealing.”
[720]~“Obeying the rules in the DPRK, you will not be able to survive. However, if you are caught breaking the rules, you can get arrested and have your life taken away.”
[731]~ Another witness stated that in 2010-2011, no food was distributed. She estimates that 40 per cent of the population could not afford buying any food when she left. The witness emphasized: “Those who do not have money, will starve.”
[733]~In one confidential interview a woman stated that in 2012, the price of rice soared and most people could no longer afford it. “The poor and the weak die of hunger”, she added.
[754] ~“After failing to shut down private markets in North Korea, currency reform was probably the only option left to neutralize the wealthy merchant class.”
[801]~He said that in 1997 “twenty four out of 75 orphans passed away from starvation… internally there was no food subsidized to the orphanages. So what we ate at the time was the remainder of the corn. We dried it and we grinded and turned it into a powder. That’s what we got, but it does not contain any nutrition and because of that, we got constipation…. There was nothing to eat in the orphanage. In 1996 and 1997, the orphanages tried to release as many children as possible because they didn’t have anything to give to the kids. So they thoughts that kids were better off begging in the streets. It would be better that starving to death sitting in the orphanage.”
[803]~“I saw a lot of kotjebi die. I was responsible for assisting them in the hospital and trying to improve their hygiene, but because they did not have clothes to keep warm in, they would sleep next to the stores of used coal [from the hearth] and get crushed and suffocate under the coal as it slid down from the pile.”
[815]~“crossing the border was not an easy thing to do, but at least, it’s better than just…dying in North Korea. If I went to China I thought I would have the least means to survive.”
[839]~“As far as the public distribution system is concerned, that was more a worker compensation system and not a social service system. As a ruler of society, if you have a limited quantity of food, you would give the food first to the most important people. The government kept most of the products for the central areas, the People’s Army, the Party. The rest is distributed to others.”
[842]~A former researcher in Pyongyang described that, “during the famine there were no dead bodies in Pyongyang. I saw them when I visited relatives in the countryside. Seeing the dead bodies, I started distrusting the regime.”
[845]~“The government thinks that the city of Pyongyang should survive even if the rest of the country starves. The food rations in Pyongyang were much more than what I received in my home province of South Hamgyong. The quality of food was also better, even though the best food was of course reserved to the top cadres.”
[858]~“In 1996, Kim Jong-il had visited Cholwon-gun in Kangwon Province. He came to inspect the battalion himself and he asked to see the food that was being provided to the soldiers. So they showed Kim Jong Il a bowl of porridge. When they turned the bowl upside down there were only three grains of rice.”
[882]~Agricultural expert Dr Kim Young-hoon, who studied the aforementioned economic reform on the basis of information available outside the DPRK, was sceptical whether it would lead to marked improvements: “The Kim Jong-un regime will also experience the same kind of capital shortage [as Kim Jong-il] and the system reform will not go forward… I am predicting that the situation will not get any better.”
[887]~“People were told that it was the Arduous March and everybody had to endure it. No one could complain. Otherwise they were sent to political prison camps.”
[893]~“In 2012, we were told that we could keep 90 per cent of the harvest. ... But when it was harvest time, the military came and took everything.”
[900]~“When the United Nations officials left, the food was given to the military. The monitoring group of the United Nations usually wanted to check that the food was distributed. They had to pre-notify the field visit. The North Korean authorities used to take the United Nations officials to the food distribution centre. Once the United Nations officials left, the North Korean authorities took the food back from the population. At the time when all this was happening, you could see dead bodies on the streets, people who had died from starvation.”
[910]~“During the process of being transferred [between detention facilities], he was not able to eat and he was not provided any water to drink. He was also tortured in the previous detention facility and he had a lot of wounds on his body, so that basically killed him.”
[960]~“[W]hile the amount of grain needed to close the gap [during the 1990s famine] was much larger, the price of grain in the 1990s was much lower than it is now. So at the famine’s peak, the resources needed to close that gap were only on the order of a hundred to two hundred million dollars depending on how you analysed data. Even during the famine period, the North Korean government had resources at its disposal if it had chosen to use them, to maintain imports and avoid that calamity.”
[990]~“Kim Jong-il had airplanes, ships, trains, helicopters, car… He did not use the plane himself but he still wanted one.”
[1000]~“In November 1996, I was very concerned about the economy and asked a top official in charge of agricultural statistics and food how many people had starved to death….[The official] replied in 1995, about 500,000 people starved to death including 50,000 party cadres. In 1996, about one million people are estimated to have starved to death. … In 1997, about 2 million people would starved to death if no international aid were provided.”
[1010]~“From my experience investigating North Korea, what I understand is that in North Korea the case is not absolute shortage of food supply. The famine in North Korea has to do with the access to food”
[1017]~“They all told me that one night when they were in bed, suddenly [State Security Department agents] came to their house and they got arrested… I was taught that the inmates were bad people. But these people, I found out, had no idea why they were there.”
[1023]~The guards told him that “when you get to this prison you are not human, you are just like animals, and as soon as you get to this prison, you have to crawl just like animals.”
[1035] ~“[Y]our hands are handcuffed behind your back. And then they hang you so you would not be able to stand or sit”
[1036]~“There are no people watching you. There is nobody. And you can’t stand, you can’t sleep. If you are hung like that for three days, four days, you urinate, you defecate, you are totally dehydrated. … [the pigeon torture] was the most painful of all tortures… [it] was so painful that I felt it was better to die.”
[1037]~“I thought the prosecutor was going to help me, but the prosecutor left and then the investigator came back in and started hitting me, started assaulting me and hanging me upside down. The next day, the prosecutor came back and said, ‘Can you talk honestly?’ And I said, ‘Yes, yes, I’m a spy’ – I confessed.”
 [1039]~“[I]t’s been ten years but I still have scars. And my teeth, since I came toSouth Korea, the South Korean Government has given me artificial teeth, but at the time my teeth were not there. And if you look at my ear, it’s been 10 years and still my ear hurts. And on my head, because I was hurt with wooden clubs. And so I still have scars, I think about 10 scars in all on the head.”
[1040]~“They just basically beat you to near death. ... If my answer did not satisfy the official interrogator than he made me kneel down on the concrete floor and started beating me.”
[1046]~“They hit me on my back dozens of times, and I almost fainted, I could not scream anymore. They stopped beating me because I could no longer scream … I think they were told to beat me until they got an answer.”
[1050]~“Seeing this prisoner’s hand I was shocked”, Mr Kim recalled, and elaborated: “He had a lump as a result of the hitting with this device that was as thick as his own hand. The guard told the prisoner to return to the cell but the prisoner could not retrieve his [swollen hand through the narrow bars] and the prisoner just squatted down and continued crying, he couldn’t do anything else.”
 [1056]~“[E]very North Korean knows [about the camps]. We have a perception that once you are in, there is no way out. It’s a cruel, cruel place, and you would guess, you are sometimes beaten by the police and so from that you can imagine how harsh the treatment would be inside.”
[1057]~“We know that once you are in, there’s no way out. Everybody knew about that. And we knew that there is no due process to enter the [political prison camp] and also that a family can disappear overnight and then people would get the hint that the family had been sent to [a prison camp].”
[1074]~“Some people served a life sentence there. Anyone who would be released from these military prisons, they could no longer survive. They couldn't get a job because of the political nature of their crime.”
[1101]~“I was born a criminal and I would die a criminal that was my fate … Where I lived only two kinds of people existed, the guards who had guns and the people who are inmates wearing uniforms. Inmates were born inmates, so we lived like inmates; that was our fate... Nobody taught us that way but that was all that we could see… so that’s how we lived.”
[1118]~“In the kwanliso, the inmates are no longer registered citizens, so you do not need a law to decide the sentences. The bowibu [SSD] agent is the person who decides whether you are saved or you are executed. There are no other criteria other than his words. [The inmates] are already eliminated from society.”
[1120]~“I heard from this new inmate, that the people outside could eat the same food as the guards, freely. I could have been electrocuted, I could have been shot but I just wanted to have one day for which I could eat all the food that the people outside [the camp] ate.”
[1124]~“The guard told the floor manager to cut off my finger, so got on my knees and I begged not to do so but that didn’t work obviously. And, I thought my whole hand was going to cut off, but it was just a finger. So, at that time I was grateful, really grateful to the guard because I was only losing a finger instead of a hand.”
[1129]~“Sometimes the instructors would summon inmates who were working in the field. They were summoned so that we could practise our [martial arts] skills on them. The reason for actually practising our skills on these inmates was to … make these inmates stay on alert and to instruct us that those are our enemies. … We did not have people to practise on, so they summoned the inmates so that we could practise our kicks and hits on them… We really don’t care if we are going to kill them or let them live.”
[1131]~“I first reported about their plan [to escape], because I was obliged to report every detail to the guards... That was the rule of the prison’s camp, so that’s why obviously I thought it was my job to report about their plan to the guard at that time. At my age, I was really proud of that. … I asked the supervisor to reward me, to give full portion of cooked, dried rice so fill my stomach. And, I was promised that reward and that’s why I reported about their plan.”
[1133]~“We were all inmates and there was nothing that I could do to them … And, they had nothing they can do as parents, so I guess I did not feel any attachment or feeling for my parents.”
[1144]~“Inmates in the [political prison camps] are not treated like human beings. They are never meant to be released...] their record is permanently erased. They are supposed to die in the camp from hard labour. And we were trained to think that those inmates are enemies. So we didn’t perceive them as human beings.”
[1145]~“[T]he dictators in North Korea thought that we should die, we were not worth living, they were just extending our lives, and they just let us live so that we would produce for them and we could die in the process working.”
[1147]~“[The] babies [had] bloated stomachs. [We] cooked snakes and mice to feed these babies and if there was a day that we were able to have a mouse, this was a special diet for us. We had to eat everything alive, every type of meat that we could find; anything that flew, that crawled on the ground. Any grass that grew in the field, we had to eat. That’s the reality of the prison camp.”
[1148]~“At that time, the economic situation was pretty stable, so I think the food [situation in the country] was okay. But for political criminals, they gave us a fistful of corn kernels once a month... after 15 days, we would run out of food, so we had to cut grass to cook porridge, to stay alive. Even fit men, healthy people, after three months, would suffer from malnutrition. In order to overcome malnutrition, we ate things like mice, snakes, frogs, worms, anything that came into our sight, in order to get protein. …The first three months after you enter the prison camp, those three months are critical. … I developed malnutrition in those three months and I came very close to dying. But kids who were there before me, they caught mice in the field for me and they saved me. … The elites, the intellectuals, the people who used to be in higher positions, they are the first ones to die because they don’t dare to eat [mice and rats]. But those who had a difficult life outside the camp, and kids, who leaned to their instincts, they had higher survival rates.”
[1152]~“[A]bout twice a week, [the guards] would choose one kid and do the inspection to see if this person is stealing something or hiding something, but she was so unlucky that she was chosen as the kid to be inspected. And, in her pocket there were some grains and then the guard asked where she got it. Then, she told the guard that she picked them up on the street. There was a wooden stick that the guards used. And, the guard says that’s not the way I taught you, so you went against my teaching. So, she was beaten so badly that she fainted, and we had to take her to her mom. When she didn’t come to school the next day, we learned that she had died.”
[1152]~“We had to make sure that the guards did not look at us when we did that. And sometimes we had to ask the guards if we were allowed to eat he crumbs that had fallen on the floor. There were lots of mice, lots and lots of them … the inmates would rush towards them, catch them, but if we saw any of the guards present, the best performing worker among us would ask the guard if we could catch and eat one of the mice. And, sometimes if the guard was in a good mood, he would give permission, but sometimes he would not give us permission to catch the mice. … Sometimes, when we caught mice without the knowledge of the guard we would hide it in our pants.”
[1153]~“Once you are in there, not a lot of people make it out. Once you are in the solitary cell, you are beaten up and they give you 30 grams per meal and you get cold, so that leads to an immediate weakness. Somebody who weighs 50 kilograms [when they go in], their weight is reduced to 20 kilograms [when they exit solitary confinement].”
[1160] ~Born as a prisoner of Camp No. 14, Mr Shin Dong-hyuk described how children received only very little education while spending most of their time farming or doing other chores. He felt that the camp authorities “were thinking that we were same as [ploughing] animals that’s why they felt that they didn’t need to teach us anything”
[1165]~“They sometimes buried bodies over other bodies. As we are digging the ground and we sometimes found the bones, and so if there is a [prison] mine, then surrounding hills, and mountains would be something like a cemetery. There is no actual cemetery for political prisoners...”
[1168]~“As the machines tore up the soil, scraps of human flesh reemerged from the final resting place; arms and legs and feet, some still some still stockinged, rolled in waves before the bulldozer. I was terrified. One of friends vomited. …. The guards then hollowed out a ditch and ordered a few detainees to toss in all the corpses and body parts that were visible on the surface.”
[1182]~“Most defendants are those whose crime has already been revealed, before indictment, through investigation by the police. When a person comes to court, we do not think of them as innocent.”
[1183]~“In North Korea, it’s just unimaginable. The judge will not ask [whether you are guilty or not] and the judge will just simply make decisions. So let’s just get this person this many years and that many years. And the judge will never ask if we are guilty or not.”
[1201]~Most people became very weak. The food they gave us was less than 80 grams per meal but if you did something wrong, if you slipped up, they would give you less. … They fed us some things that not even the pigs would eat, like for example, rotten cucumber. Boiled rotten cucumber was given to eat. And if we refused to eat that we would be punished. Sometimes we would be punished by being given less than 50 grams [of food]
[1202]~“I knew I had to survive on my own. So I would eat anything, and I ate lizards, snakes, rats, whether it was reptiles, whatever.… in the springtime, I would eat grass, but if you eat the wrong grass, then you would get poisoned and you would get all the swelling and bloated. I would eat different types of grass and the roots.”
[1220]~“Everybody suffers from malnutrition. In the jail, they determine whether you are physically weak or not by stripping you naked and they see how your butt cheeks are. If your butt cheeks are apart and loose, the guards see if their fists can fit in between the butt cheeks. And that’s how they determine whether if you are weak or not. The person standing up received ‘class 1st weakness’, the one standing to his sideways is ‘2nd class’, and the third person is ‘3rd class’. So if you are determined to be weak like them, you will never make it out of this camp.”
[1222]~“She began to lose a lot of weight to the point that she could not get up, and eat with her own hand … there was nothing I could do. I could not give her any medicine. And when she died, she couldn’t even close her eyes. She died with her eyes open. I cried my heart out.”
[1240]~“You see so many bodies, dead bodies, coming out of the detention centres. People who try to escape [the DPRK] are the first ones to go out dead.”
[1241]~“We were given … corn-based food, just enough to keep us alive. For young male inmates, [the food provided] was very insufficient, so male inmates would find worms or snakes in the field when they were working there. They would eat them alive to feel that feeling in the stomach.”
[1252]~“They would take us to these public executions like a field trip, so that nobody dares think about disobeying the Party and disobeying the ideology of Kim Il-sung.”
[1253]~“People who stole property that was considered belonging to the state and those who were caught stealing other people’s property were publicly executed. Because of this, we didn’t feel like we had control of our own life. We did not even have the right to end our own life.”
[1287]~“So once a happy family, we were broken. … The pain that I experienced in the past still persists after 60 years. We still live in that pain. I still cry from the memories.”
[1320] ~“According to the list which we have submitted we have taken a total of 12,000 men prisoner, of which 4,416 are foreigners and the rest South Koreans. Among the prisoners are 300 American pilots, of which more than 30 are officers. About 27,000 South Koreans have transferred to units of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. These POWs have not been reported in the press.”
[1334]~“I didn’t do anything wrong in North Korea. I served 47 years in North Korea. I did everything they asked me to do. I was in forced labour for decades. I did nothing wrong in North Korea... So before I die, it was my wish to return to my hometown where my family lived and I was going to testify about what North Korea did.”
[1376]~“We were sent to the spy school. We didn’t know why we needed this school. They said to us, if you graduate from this school, you will receive far more privileges or benefits than graduating from other schools. And they were threatening us even, so we had no choice but to go to this spy school. So, we received education at that school for 3 years and 8 months.”
[1378]~“We had to sign documents with our fingerprints pledging that we would not talk about our abduction to North Korea. … If we told anybody in society that we had been abducted, we would have been taken to political prison camps. We graduated and we joined the North Korean society and we did whatever we were told to do.”
[1382]~“The son, the child of a South Korean, is prevented from getting higher education. The descendants of those who are loyal to the government, who did service for the North Korean government, are only permitted to go to university. … I told him that I would do, even give my life for him to get higher education. In South Korea, my son graduated from KoreaUniversity. He studied electric engineering and he is doing very well. But in North Korea, just because I came from South Korea, my kids, my son did not have access to higher education, good education. Anybody who has experienced life in North Korea is aware of this, of such fact.”
[1389] ~“the DPRK is where my heart, body and everything is rooted”
[1434]~“With respect to the outstanding issues of concern related to the lives and security of Japanese nationals, the DPRK side confirmed that it would take appropriate measures so that these regrettable incidents, that took place under the abnormal bilateral relationship, would never happen in the future.”
[1452]~“The three people cooperated with Shin Gwang-su, followed his order, and kidnapped a chef working in Osaka whose name was Hara Tadaaki, and he brought this man to Kyushu where there he was met by other spies from North Korea put him in a bag, and forced him to get on the vessel to take him back to the DPRK.”
[1464]~“We cannot stop our activities to save the victims of abductions.”
[1466]~“I don’t know exactly, but probably hundreds of Japanese nationals. Everyone [Yodo-go members and spouses at the Revolutionary Village] was carrying out abductions, they were only ever spoken about as ‘jobs’ or ‘activities’; people would say x person completed two successful jobs. That is how I knew everyone was doing it.”
